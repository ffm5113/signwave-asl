# SignWave ASL

This research presents SignWave™, an innovative alpha-numeric American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system developed by Forrest Moulin, which uniquely combines computer vision, machine learning, and salient object detection techniques. Leveraging background noise removal preprocessing and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), SignWave recorded an outstanding 99.97% validation accuracy on a compact dataset of 2.25 GB, representing 36 ASL gesture classes A-Z and 1-10.

Trained on a cloud virtual machine without a graphics processing unit (GPU), the model’s efficiency is highlighted by its use of only 20 epochs, and the results demonstrate that high-accuracy sign language recognition (SLR) can be achieved with accessible computing resources. Designed for real-time sign language interpretation software, SignWave aims to enhance communication between sign language users and non-signers. By showcasing noticeable accuracy, efficiency, and a broader range of classes than some contemporary methods, this research has the potential to advance communication accessibility.
